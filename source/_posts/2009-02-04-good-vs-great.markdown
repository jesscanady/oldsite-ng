**There's more to this: [part two](http://joncanady.com/2009/02/good-vs-great-redux-communication/) covers more ground.**

I've had a [GitHub](http://github.com) account for a while, but I just today started using it to host stuff.  Nothing major, just my [.emacs.d config directory](http://github.com/joncanady/dotemacs), but still.  That's not *really* the point.

## Github Didn't Work

Just in case you run into it, the situation was: I'd created the new repository but couldn't actually push anything into it.  It turns out, I'd renamed my account earlier in the day and GitHub hadn't migrated my SSH keys over.  If this happens, just delete and re-add your SSH keys under the "Account" link, and you're set.

Normally to find a solution like that you have to do some serious Google-work, or put up with a support interface that's [old and busted](http://www.bugzilla.org), or just stumble across the fix.  Instead of all that, GitHub has a really awesome support setup that meant I didn't even break a sweat.

## Now I Love Github

Github uses the awesome [Tender Support](http://tenderapp.com/) system to handle their support requests.  It's fully integrated with email, so you never have to visit the site again after the initial request; the interface is *very* easy, and GitHub always seems to have someone watching to reply to your issue.  Mine was resolved in, *no joke*, ten minutes.

*Ten minutes.*

Generally as software developers we know that our products or services need to have good support channels, but it's amazing the difference a *great* support channel can make.  It's the difference in a 24-hour turnaround vs. a 10-minute turnaround, or the difference between "These guys are good" and "These guys are fan*tastic* and I'm going to tell all my friends about them."

Also: GitHub's pretty sweet, have you tried them out yet?
