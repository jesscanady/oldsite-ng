title: When has Ruby on Rails failed?
---

There's an awesome post on Hacker News this afternoon about how two
self-described Pythonistas [fell in love with Ruby on
Rails](http://blog.brandonbloom.name/2010/09/how-two-pythonistas-accidentally-fell.html).

In the [HN comments](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1686921),
quite a few people commented that once Rails stops working for them
they'll start to hate it. The same old arguments came out: "Rails is
hard to scale", "Once you get beyond the basics Rails gets in your
way", etc.

I'm no Rails pro; I've been using it for slightly over a year. In that
time it's completely won me over, replacing almost every single place
I'd use PHP. Every time I hear someone bag on Rails, I get confused,
because nobody ever provides a concrete example of when Rails really
screwed a project up.

(Aside: No, don't say Twitter. Twitter's problem, as I understand it,
was application architecture. If they'd built on top of Django or Zend
Framework, they'd have seen the same problems.)

So please, if you have any "Rails ruined my project" or "I tried to
use Rails on a project, but it got in my way and I had to abandon it"
stories, please email them to jon at this domain, or respond in the
[Hacker News thread](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1687974). I'm curious how many are legitimate, and how
many are "Rails isn't like my preferred Blub, so I can't use it."
