I'm harsh on you sometimes, so I thought it should be said:

If the city looks like a powdered donut, and when you're driving on the freeway you *can't see the lane lines*, it's perfectly fine to drive 20 MPH.  In fact, it's the responsible way to drive, so good on you.

To the guy doing 50 MPH in the fast lane when the rest of the freeway was taking it nice and slow: I hope you know what your truck can and can't handle.  If not, my Dad owns Auto Damage Appraisers of Ohio, feel free to call.
