title: Boxee is Slick

I've been using [Boxee](http://boxee.tv) on my Mac Mini for a while to stream video to my HDTV.  I used to run [XBMC](http://xbmc.org/) on my modded XBox, but the magic smoke escaped.

Boxee is a fantastic port of XBMC to the Mac, but it also integrates a social network that I'd love to take more advantage of: except all my friends that are tech enough to run media centers either don't own a Mac to run it on, or already have a setup and don't want to switch.

So, anyone in the Columbus Ohio area (or not, it doesn't matter) care to exchange Boxee friendships?  I'm `joncanady`!
