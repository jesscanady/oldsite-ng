title: Another iPhone MMS Rant

My sister-in-law's boyfriend just got a new HDTV setup and decided to text me a picture of it.  My iPhone failed in the usual way:

- Instead of his picture, I get a message that directs me to http://viewmymessage.com/1 (Yep, that /1 is important.  No, it doesn't redirect you properly based on your login and password.)  I get an randomly-generated username and a password that's fairly easy to remember.  I can't copy/paste these things.  
- Instead of fucking around with MobileSafari (writing down the username and password so I don't have to switch back and forth between the iPhone's singular running applicaiton), I sit down at my computer and go to the website.
- Website demands I use /1 or /2 on the URL, meaning I have to examine the link to see what's what.
- Type in credentials, "Failure encountered during view message."
- Repeat five times, sixth time actually works.  I get a very tiny photograph.  Hooray.

This is my $400 Jesusphone at work.  Sure, I can type like a dream.  I can shake my phone to find a restaurant or wave it around like a lightsaber or SSH into my home server and check on stuff.  But the free Motorola that comes with a Verizon account can send and receive pictures!  

On any other phone, the procedure is thus:

- Flip open your phone.  Yay, picture!  Perhaps even save picture locally!

There's lots to love about the iPhone, but there's also *lots* to hate.  And this amateur-hour bullshit regarding MMS that hasn't even been so much as *commented on* by Apple is just the tip of the iceberg.  Stay tuned for such thrills as:

- Why does my email client suck?
- My friends can run two programs at once, why can't I?
- I hear background services are cool and useful!
- My springboard (home screen) is about as organized as my physical desk (which is to say *not at all*)
