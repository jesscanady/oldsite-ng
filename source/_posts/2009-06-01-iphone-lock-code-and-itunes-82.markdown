title: iPhone Lock Code and iTunes 8.2

Installed the iTunes 8.2 update, docked my phone, and saw a new error message:

![iTunes 8.2: cannot unlock due to passcode](/images/iphone_sync.png)

I don't know how to feel about this.  The security-conscious (read: paranoid) part of me thinks it's probably a good idea to not let just anyone do a sync of your locked and protected iPhone.  The lazy jerk part of me that just wants to slap his phone in a dock and have the damn thing sync is a little miffed right now.

I wonder how helpful this really is?  Is the control built into iTunes or the iPhone itself?  Could someone *not* using iTunes pull a dump down of the iPhone's HDD?
