Last night the Mrs. and I decided to try [Dewey's Pizza](http://www.deweyspizza.com/) in Grandview for dinner.  Ever since my trip to New York last year for the OWASP 2008 Security Conference, I've tried to find a good New York-style pizza in Columbus.  

As an aside: most pizza in Columbus is thin-crust, crispy, with relatively little actual crust surrounding the pizza, and cut into squares.  Dewey's is definitely New York-style pizza: cut in pie-shape slices (you'd be shocked at how this change the pizza-eating experience), a generous amount of crust around the pizza, with softer, more flexible crust.  

We ordered a 1/2 Hawaiian (red sauce, pineapple, canadian bacon), 1/2 Bronx Bomber (red sauce, pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, bell pepper, onion, black olive).  Red sauce is to differentiate here from Dewey's "White Sauce" (no jokes), a white pizza-style cheese-based sauce.  Both were delicious: the ingredients were fresh, the crust was chewy and flavorful (but not dominating, it's the *crust* for goodness' sake), and the slices were just the right size.

This ends the portion of our show where I talk like I'm some kind of pizza connoisseur.

So what else?  Dewey's has a small but excellent selection of beers on tap:

* Scrimshaw Pilsner (California)
* Rogue Dead Guy Ale (Oregon)
* Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA (Delaware)
* Columbus Brewing Co. Seasonal (Ohio)
* Brooklyn Brown (New York)
* Bells Seasonal (Michigan)
* Sierra Nevada Pale Ale (California)
* Guinness (Ireland)

That afternoon I'd had some dental work done (filling cavities) and my gums were a little sore, so I chose to go with the Guinness, which I knew wasn't going to bother me any.

The service is pretty damn fine, too.  When we first sat down, our server asked if we'd ever eaten before, and explained the various sauces and seasonal options on the menu.  Having grown up on places that *don't* explain these types of things, this is still refreshing every time it happens.  Kelli even noticed that they had about six servers on the floor for maybe 15 customers: some of them were standing around, but I bet when the place gets busy they've got it covered.  And Kelli never wanted for a water refill.

That got a little more detailed than I was planning, but [someone](http://techfoodhorsepower.com/) demanded I do a full review.  Also [another *five* awesome photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jcanady/sets/72157616146663644) if that's your thing.
