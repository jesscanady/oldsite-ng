I know it snowed last night, but you've *got* to get over this irrational fear of precipitation!  If you're on the freeway, you can probably even go above 20 MPH.  If you find you're unwilling/unable to, your options are:

* stay off of the freeway, and make the world a better place
* keep to the rightmost lane, and endure the unending swears from your fellow motorists

**Also, to the guy I honked at on I-71 S this morning**: yes, when you speed up to block my freeway access even though there was *1.5 car-lengths* between you and the guy in front of you, you're going to get honked at.  Throwing me the finger *doesn't mean you weren't wrong.*
