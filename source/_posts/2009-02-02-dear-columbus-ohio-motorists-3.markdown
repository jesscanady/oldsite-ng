Turn signals are important!  Unless they were optional on your vehicle, please respect the following rules:

1. Use them!  Whether changing lanes on the freeway or swinging out of a parking lot, it's usually a safe bet to flick the signal on, even if "it's obvious" which way you were going.  (Corollary: remember to turn them *off*.)
2. Don't depend on them: turn signals *do not* give you the right of way.  They *signal* other drivers as to your intentions.  Swinging out into the path of oncoming traffic isn't cool.  "But I *had* my turn signal on!" isn't a valid excuse.

To the (few) Columbus Ohio drivers that actually understand how their turn signals work: *thank you*, you restore my faith that people in this town know how to drive.

Also, to the guy that parked his F-350 in a compact car space and took up 2.5 of them: seriously?  That's a dick move.  I can't be mad at you *personally* because there are constantly trucks parked in the small spaces next to Nationwide, but *still.*  Maybe if you weren't driving a large work truck as your daily driver we wouldn't run into this issue, hmm?
